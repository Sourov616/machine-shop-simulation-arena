# Machine Shop Simulation (Arena)

## Overview
This repository contains an academic discrete-event simulation assignment
developed using Arena software. The model represents a machine shop system
with multiple processing stages and shared resources.

## Problem Description
The simulation models entity flow through machines, queues, and resources
to evaluate system performance under given operating conditions.

## Model File
- Machine_Shop_Simulation.doe  
  Arena model implementing the machine shop system.

## Performance Measures
- Average waiting time
- Queue length
- Resource utilization
- Throughput

## How to Open
1. Open Arena Simulation Software
2. Load the file: Machine_Shop_Simulation.doe
3. Run the model using default parameters

## Notes
This work was completed as part of an academic simulation assignment.
